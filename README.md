- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Abhijit Swain (abhijitswain09).

- ðŸŽ“ I recently completed my MSc in Bioinformatics from Chandigarh University, where I gained expertise in various aspects of bioinformatics and computational biology.

- ðŸ”¬ During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting 6-month dissertation program at CSIR-IHBT. My research focused on the construction of gene co-expression and Bayesian networks for Arabidopsis thaliana, exploring the intricate relationships between genes.

- ðŸ’» I have a strong passion for NGS data analysis and network biology, where I love deciphering biological insights hidden within complex datasets.

- ðŸ§¬ Additionally, I have a keen interest in proteomics, particularly in areas like drug designing and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS).

- ðŸŒ± I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of bioinformatics, and I'm open to collaborating on projects that involve innovative data analysis and bioinformatics tools.

- ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me, and let's explore the fascinating world of bioinformatics together!
