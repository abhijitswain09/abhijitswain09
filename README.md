Hi there! I’m Abhijit Swain 👋

🏢 I’m currently working as a Senior Bioinformatician at Genomiki Solutions Pvt. Ltd., where I handle end-to-end bioinformatics workflows across diagnostic and research-driven projects. My work spans rare disease analysis, newborn screening, carrier screening, and oncology, with a strong focus on building robust, clinically relevant solutions.

🧬 I have extensive experience in clinical variant analysis, interpretation, and reporting using population databases and knowledge resources such as ClinVar, OMIM, MalaCards, Franklin, gnomAD, and multiple in silico pathogenicity prediction algorithms (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster, etc.). I actively work on translating complex genomic data into meaningful clinical insights.

💻 Beyond analysis, I am involved in research and product development, including the design and development of bioinformatics portals and web-based platforms for diagnostics and genomic data interpretation. I collaborate closely with clinicians, researchers, and developers to create scalable and user-friendly solutions.

🎓 I hold an MSc in Bioinformatics from Chandigarh University, where I built a strong foundation in computational biology and data analysis.

🔬 During my academic journey, I completed a 6-month dissertation at CSIR–IHBT, focusing on gene co-expression and Bayesian network construction in Arabidopsis thaliana to uncover complex gene–gene interaction networks.

🧪 My core interests include NGS data analysis, network biology, clinical genomics, and translational bioinformatics. I also have a keen interest in proteomics, drug designing, and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS).

🌱 I’m always eager to learn, innovate, and collaborate on projects that bridge genomics, technology, and healthcare, especially those aimed at improving early diagnosis and precision medicine.
